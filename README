# Diffrence between JavaScript & TypeScript
## Static typed language like [Rust, C, C++]
> - variable types are static, once  you declare it you cannot change
> - type a variable is known at compile time "do tpe checking at compile-type"
> - have better performance at run-type due to not needing to check types dynamiccally 
> - error detected earlier

## Dynamic typed language like [Php, Python, JavaScript]
> - variable types are dynamic, you can always change it
> - type checking at execution time
> - error can be detected after execution
